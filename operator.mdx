_Brief description of bundle from an operator's point of view_

## Use Cases

_Common use cases for this bundle_

### Guided Configs

+ Production enables monitoring and sets a longer message retention window.

## Design

### How It Works

+ This bundle creates a _topic_, in GCP that is PubSub
+ You can enable monitoring, alarms will be sent to Massdriver

#### Best Practices

#### Security

+ Note: Pub/Sub is not associated with any specific IP address. This is relevant if you rely on IP-based firewall rules.
+ No access outside the GCP project is provided

#### Auditing

#### Compliance

#### Observability

+ The bundle ships with the ability to alarm on one threshold, the `pubsub.googleapis.com/topic/retained_bytes` metric.
